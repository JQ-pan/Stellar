# [Stellar](https://jq-pan.github.io/Stellar/)

Stellar is an application that renders data about a particular city or town after prompting the user to enter a location. Stellar will display the city's weather conditions as well as astronomy features.

# Functionality & MVPs

- View the inputed city's weather conditions as well as a rendered view of the astronomy from the given location.

## In *Stellar*, users will be able to:

- Use a search option to look up cities. The app will fetch the city's data from an API and use it to display today's weather details including temperature, air quality data, as well as astronomy.
- Display a map that allows the user to click on a city to view the city's weather data.
- Read the data displayed on a clear table.
- View the constellations and astronomy that is relevant to the location 

## In addition, this project will include:

- An About modal describing the background and structure of the data visualization.
- This production README
